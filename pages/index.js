          <h2>FAQ</h2>
          <div className="mt-4 grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-10">
            <Question title="Where is this held?">
              Due to COVID-19, NeoHacks is completely virtual and will take
              place on Zoom and Discord.
            </Question>
            <Question title="What is a hackathon?">
              A hackathon is a great place to learn new skills, make new
              friends, and have fun. By the end of the hackathon, you will have
              turn in a project for feedback from judges.
            </Question>
            <Question title="Who is eligible to participate?">
              This hackathon is open to anyone regardless of their identity. We
              highly encourage beginners to participate!
            </Question>
            <Question title="How can I prepare for a hackathon?">
              No advanced preparation is necessary! We have workshops tailored
              to those who are new to coding and intro workshops to help
              beginner hackers.
            </Question>
            <Question title="What if I don't have a team?">
              There will be several team formation opportunities before and
              during the event. Although working with a team (of 1-4 hackers) is
              highly encouraged, you may choose to work alone.
